## About Me

With over 11 years of experience in frontend development and a strong focus on React and TypeScript, I bring a proven ability to deliver scalable, high-performance web applications.

Proficient in performance optimization, component-based architecture (FSD), and animation-driven UI/UX using GSAP.

Currently working at EcoPoint, where I develop reusable components, integrate REST APIs, and enhance user experience through smooth, high-performance interfaces.

I‚Äôm a proactive team player who contributes to architectural decisions, code reviews, and testing processes using tools like Jest and Cypress. Passionate about clean code, intuitive design, and delivering real business value.
