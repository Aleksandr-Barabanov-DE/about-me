<h1>Hi there, I'm <a href="https://barabanov.codes/" target="_blank">Aleksandr Barabanov</a> ðŸ‘‹
 
## I am a Frontend Developer with a proven track record in building scalable, high-performance web applications. My expertise lies in React, TypeScript, Redux, and API integrations, and I am passionate about creating intuitive, dynamic user interfaces.

## About Me

My professional journey began in 2013, when I worked on projects for small and medium-sized businesses, handling everything from design and CRM integration to SEO optimization and improving UI/UX, helping clients achieve higher conversion rates and top positions in search engines.

In 2021, I focused on deepening my knowledge of JavaScript, React, and related technologies to build complex user interfaces and applications beyond the limitations of website builders. Today, I have experience working in teams where I contributed to the development of high-load applications using React, TypeScript, Redux, and Material-UI, as well as optimizing performance and enhancing user experience.

Working in a 13-person team on large-scale projects, I have learned how to collaborate effectively with colleagues, implement architectural decisions, participate in planning, and conduct code reviews. Additionally, I have mastered application testing using Jest and Cypress and optimized Webpack builds.

My goal is to continue growing as a frontend developer, deepening my skills in building modern web applications, improving UX/UI, and working with high-load systems.

I am eager to contribute to the development of your project, using my experience and technical expertise to create user-friendly, high-performance, and innovative interfaces that address business challenges and enhance the user experience.
